# Project Zeal
This is going to be a project that I can showcase some of my capabilities as someone who can design and engineer a website. I will use REACT as the framework for this site as to better understand the workings of REACT. Previously I was making this site in MVC .net, but it is better to expand my horizons on the various options available to me. 

This site will just have a banner and possibly some example code from my first react site. Then I will work my way up to there.
